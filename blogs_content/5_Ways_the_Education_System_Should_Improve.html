              <h3>5 Ways the Education System Should Improve</h3>
           </div>
          <p>The history of education system in India runs back to when it had the Gurukul system in which anyone who wished to study went to a Guru (teacher) and requested to be taught. If accepted by the guru, the child was taught everything from mathematics to metaphysics. All learning was closely linked to nature &amp; to life. Today&#39;s system is primarily focused on preparing people for jobs. The thought of studying for the sake of studying is alien &amp; people focus from an early age on learning skills for the job they will do later in life, rather than on learning because they enjoy acquiring knowledge. This system does not nurture creativity or encourage people to focus on innovation.</p>

<p>This system, while incredibly good at preparing children for tests &amp; producing school leavers with a good work ethic, put undue pressure on their students. Rote learning &amp; high volumes of homework are all well &amp; good, but if the price is burnout, high suicide rates &amp; students that lack creative thinking skills, maybe the system is failing?</p>

<p><strong>1. Encouraging individuality</strong></p>

<p>The objective of education is to educate &amp; empower people to achieve desired goals in their lives. Not every kid wants to grow up to be an engineer or a doctor. The child needs to be allowed to explore to realise what he/she aspire to be. The issue with the current system is that all students study the same subjects &amp; go through the exact same method of education. Basic literacy is necessary but at some point, they will need a broader range of options to choose from and to be encouraged to opt for a field of study of their choice.</p>

<p><strong>2. Good teachers get good results </strong></p>

<p>Teacher plays a huge role in who a child becomes in the future. In India the education &amp; creativity of a teacher seems not to be a matter of concern. In Finnish schools, that have gone from being some of the worst performers to some of the best, teaching is the most desired profession. You must earn a master&#39;s degree to be a teacher. Only 1 in 10 applications for a job as a primary school teacher is accepted. Competition to become a teacher is must be fierce. The reasoning is simple - good teachers get good results.</p>

<p><strong>3. Creative blend in learning</strong></p>

<p>We have been pioneers of mathematics &amp; science but that is not all we can do. There has to be an equal emphasis on other social &amp; literary subjects. A change in curriculum to add creative subjects along with the regular maths &amp; science will create a great blend &amp; help students understand the bigger picture right from the beginning rather than realizing their actual passion in the latter halves of their education or in the worst case never realizing it.</p>

<p><strong>4. What the government can do?</strong></p>

<p>Education needs to be available to all. In recent times several major announcements were made for developing the poor state &amp; affairs in education sector in India. The most notable ones being- a) a progressive increase in expenditure on education to around 6% of GDP (from the previous 3% expenditure), b) to ensure that no one is denied of education due to poverty. But the implementation of these changes is what has to be made sure.</p>

<p><strong>5. Study to learn not earn - </strong></p>

<p>Every child&rsquo;s dream is unique and the only person who can guide one to reach their destination is oneself. Educational institutes, along with the elemental subjects must teach the students to be articulate &amp; erudite. Only the ones capable of holding themselves together can achieve happiness. Hence, the main goal of the education system must be to help students grow as better human beings.</p>

<p>To sum it all, education needs to be available to all, but overall development needs to be a part of the curriculum too. The need of the hour is to develop a system wherein kids are not forced to be showpieces of their hard work in the form of a grading system. Allow them to be curious &amp; take up subjects they are really interested in early in their careers.</p>

<p>A country with perfect education system is as close to a utopia as we will ever get.</p>
